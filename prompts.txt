# Prompts Used for Development

## Initial Prompt
"Integration Assignment: Bidirectional ClickHouse & Flat File Data Ingestion Tool - Create a web-based application with a simple user interface that facilitates data ingestion between a ClickHouse database and Flat Files. Support bidirectional data flow, JWT token authentication, column selection, and record count reporting."

## Detailed Project Structure Planning
"Create a project structure for a Flask web application that will handle bidirectional data transfer between ClickHouse and flat files, with user authentication via JWT tokens."

## ClickHouse Client Implementation
"Implement a Python class for interacting with ClickHouse database that supports JWT token authentication, retrieving table schema, and efficient data ingestion."

## Flat File Handling Implementation
"Create a Python class for handling flat file operations including reading CSV files with custom delimiters, column selection, and saving data to files."

## Frontend UI Design
"Design a responsive HTML/CSS/JS user interface for a data ingestion tool that allows users to select source/target, configure connections, select columns, and view progress/results."

## API Endpoint Implementation
"Implement Flask API endpoints for connecting to ClickHouse, uploading flat files, previewing data, and handling bidirectional data ingestion processes."

## JavaScript Client-Side Logic
"Write JavaScript code to handle form submission, API calls, UI state management, and data visualization for a data ingestion web application."

## Testing and Documentation
"Create comprehensive README documentation explaining how to install, configure and use a ClickHouse and Flat File data ingestion tool, including examples and testing instructions."
